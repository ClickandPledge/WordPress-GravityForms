<strong>  About Click & Pledge </strong> <br>
Click & Pledge was Founded in May 2000. To be sure, Click & Pledge is not too good to be true. It is, however, a Company that has changed the way non-profits do business. Not only do we deliver the most comprehensive cloud-based fundraising and management products, but we lower your risk, save you money and offer exciting new ways for organizations to run. Since 2002, Click & Pledge has served over 10,000 customers in 46 countries…and we’re carefully expanding. Good, but not too good to be true.
